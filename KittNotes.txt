public User signIn(String email, String password) throws Exception{
        //data we're working with: email, password
        //check if the user exist in the database based on the email given
        User foundUser = userRepository.findByEmail(email);
        //if a user is returned from the database
        if(foundUser != null){
            //if the found user's password matches the user's password
            if(passwordEncoder.matches(password, foundUser.getPassword())){
                //output the authenticated user
                return foundUser;
            }
            else{
                //wrong password was entered. throw exception
                throw new Exception("Invalid credentials. Try password again");
            }
        }
        throw new Exception("No account exists with the given email");
